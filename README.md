Manner-Prediction-Project
=========================

## Background
Using devices such as Jawbone Up, Nike FuelBand, and Fitbit it is now possible to collect a large amount of data about personal activity relatively inexpensively. These type of devices are part of the quantified self movement – a group of enthusiasts who take measurements about themselves regularly to improve their health, to find patterns in their behavior, or because they are tech geeks. One thing that people regularly do is quantify how much of a particular activity they do, but they rarely quantify how well they do it. In this project, my goal will be to use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants. They were asked to perform barbell lifts correctly and incorrectly in 5 different ways. More information is available from [the website](http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har) (see the section on the Weight Lifting Exercise Dataset). 

##Problem
Six young health participants were asked to perform one set of 10 repetitions of the Unilateral Dumbbell Biceps Curl in five different fashions: exactly according to the specification (Class A), throwing the elbows to the front (Class B), lifting the dumbbell only halfway (Class C), lowering the dumbbell only halfway (Class D) and throwing the hips to the front (Class E).

Class A corresponds to the specified execution of the exercise, while the other 4 classes correspond to common mistakes. 
Participants were supervised by an experienced weight lifter to make sure the execution complied to the manner they were supposed to simulate

The goal of my project is to predict the manner in which they did the exercise. This is the "classe" variable in the training set.

##Tools used to produce this project
- This project is built by `knirt` package instllled on RStudio with RMD (R Markdown) format.

- The  `mannerPrediction.md` and `mannerPrediction.html` file will be  automatically  produced by `mannerPrediction.md`

##Steps to produce this project 

- Plsease see the details in `mannerPrediction.md`.

- This file  contain the instructions and steps with R code embedded  to produce this project.

##Steps to reproduce this project

-  Open Rstudio to open R  Markdown file  `mannerPrediction.Rmd` to build the Project , then `mannerPrediction.md` and `mannerPrediction.html`  will be produced.
